# Plant Pattern

## About
  Plant Pattern is an application where a user can track their plants, how they've grown, how they water them, information regarding substrate, topping, fertilizer, and companion planting. The application will offer users self-directed development through complicated plant care techniques, as well as offering reminders to check on certain plants

## Development
  Plant Pattern is currently in development, starting December 11th, 2019. It is being developed by John Bishop, who is currently living in Grand Rapids, MI. This application is for the public portal, where most users will be interacting.

### Pathway
  There is a lot that has to be done for the development of Plant Pattern. I am starting by defining the objects that will be involved. I will then be creating basic interfaces to display the data, based upon example objects that I will be creating. Each interface will have an automated testing suite set up for it. Then, when an interface is ready for data, an api pathway will be created that will allow the interface to pull and store information in a database.

  My plan is to create a UI library, with small, modular components that can be tested extensively. Then, there will be small individual front-ends that will be packaged and collated into this application. This should allow me some freedom in developing and maintaining each piece, while ensuring that the functionality is decoupled from the implementation.
